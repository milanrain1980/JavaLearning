 * A thread cannot acquire a lock owned by another thread. 
 * But a thread can acquire a lock that it already owns. 
 * Allowing a thread to acquire the same lock more than once enables reentrant synchronization.
 *  
 * This describes a situation where synchronized code, directly or indirectly, 
 * invokes a method that also contains synchronized code, and both sets of code use the same lock. 
 * Without reentrant synchronization, synchronized code would have to take many additional precautions 
 * to avoid having a thread cause itself to block.
