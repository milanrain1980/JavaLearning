 * Lock splitting:
 * Another technique to reduce lock contention is to split one lock into a number of smaller scoped locks. 
 * This technique can be applied if you have one lock for guarding different aspects of your application. 
 * Assume we want to collect some statistical data about our application and implement a simple counter class 
 * that holds for each aspect a primitive counter variable. 
 * As our application is multi-threaded, we have to synchronize access to these variables, 
 * as they are accessed from different concurrent threads. 
 * The easiest way to accomplish this is to use the synchronized keyword within the method signature 
 * for each method of Counter:

	/**
	 * Another possible improvement is to separate locks even more by distinguishing between read and write locks. 
	 * The Counter class for example provides methods for reading and writing the counter value. 
	 * While reading the current value can be done by more than one thread in parallel, 
	 * all write operations have to be serialized. 
	 * The java.util.concurrent package provides a ready to use implementation of such a ReadWriteLock.
	 * 
	 * The ReentrantReadWriteLock implementation manages two separate locks. 
	 * One for read accesses and one for write accesses. 
	 * Both the read and the write lock offer methods for locking and unlocking. 
	 * The write lock is only acquired, if there is no read lock. 
	 * The read lock can be acquired by more than on reader thread, as long as the write lock is not acquired. 
	 * For demonstration purposes the following shows an implementation of the counter class using a ReadWriteLock:
	 * 
	 * All read accesses are guarded by an acquisition of the read lock, 
	 * while all write accesses are guarded by the corresponding write lock. 
	 * In case the application uses much more read than write accesses, 
	 * this kind of implementation can even gain more performance improvement than 
	 * this one as all the reading threads can access the getter method in parallel.

	/**
	 * Another way to reduce lock contention is to use so called atomic operations. 
	 * This principle is explained and evaluated in more detail in one of the following articles. 
	 * The java.util.concurrent package offers support for atomic operations for some primitive data types. 
	 * Atomic operations are implemented using the so called compare-and-swap (CAS) operation 
	 * provided by the processor. The CAS instruction only updates the value of a certain register, 
	 * if the current value equals the provided value. Only in this case the old value is replaced by the new value.
	 * 
	 * This principle can be used to increment a variable in an optimistic way. 
	 * If we assume our thread knows the current value, then it can try to increment it by using the CAS operation. 
	 * If it turns out, that another thread has meanwhile incremented the value and our value is no longer the current one, 
	 * we request the current value and try with it again. 
	 * This can be done until we successfully increment the counter. 
	 * The advantage of this implementation, although we may need some spinning, 
	 * is that we donâ€™t need any kind of synchronization.
