/**
 * Semaphores are used to control access to a shared resource. 
 * In contrast to simple synchronized blocks a semaphore has an internal counter 
 * that is increased each time a thread acquires a lock and decreased each time a thread releases a lock it obtained before. 
 * The increasing and decreasing operations are of course synchronized, 
 * hence a semaphore can be used to control how many threads pass simultaneously through a critical section. 
 * 
 * To illustrate the described behavior, letâ€™s setup a simple thread pool with five threads 
 * but control through a semaphore that at each point in time not more than three of them are running:
